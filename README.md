# PicoSystemInfoNesLoader

A Windows companion app for the [PicoSystem_InfNes NES emulator](https://github.com/fhoedemakers/PicoSystem_InfoNes), running on a [Pimoroni PicoSystem](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picosystem).

Because there is no SD card available, this application lets the user choose NES roms from the local file system and flash them to the PicoSystem.

It is also possible to flash a new version of the Emulator to the PicoSystem.
